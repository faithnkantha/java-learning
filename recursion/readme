Java Recursion
Recursion is the technique of making a function call itself. This technique provides a way to break complicated problems down into simple problems which are easier to solve.

Recursion may be a bit difficult to understand. The best way to figure out how it works is to experiment with it.

Halting Condition
Just as loops can run into the problem of infinite looping, recursive functions can run into the problem of infinite recursion.
Infinite recursion is when the function never stops calling itself. 
Every recursive function should have a halting condition, which is the condition where the function stops calling itself.
The developer should be very careful with recursion as it can be quite easy to slip into writing a function which never terminates, 
or one that uses excess amounts of memory or processor power. However, when written correctly recursion can be a very efficient and mathematically-elegant approach to programming.
